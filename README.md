# Helper Log Translator
Replaces area names in the Hollow Knight Helper Log generated by Randomizer 4.

This is based on ManicJamie's translation file (https://github.com/ManicJamie/HKTranslator/blob/master/TranslatorDictionary.xml) and the icon for the app is made by u/Mr_MOO (https://www.reddit.com/r/HollowKnight/comments/8d5fpf/simple_hollow_knight_flat_icons/).

The GUI is built using tkinter, in a very inefficient way.

# Use
The program should be able to work from wherever it is placed. It will automatically find the folder where the Helper Log is located, and will place the translated log in the same location.

There is no need to download the xml translation file, as the program will try to download it automatically if it isn't found. If the download fails, you will get an error message and you can try downloading it directly from ManicJamie's github.

The "Open File" button will use the app associated with .txt files by default.

# Suggestions
I only code things for personnal use, so I've never really learned how to properly code certain things. If you have any suggestions feel free to DM me on Discord (asimard#8855).
